üî• **Project Title**

‚ÄúProduction-Ready CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices on AWS using Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible‚Äù

üéØ **Objective**

To design and implement a fully automated, secure, and scalable CI/CD pipeline for deploying a microservices-based web application on AWS, using modern DevOps tools and practices.

üß∞ **Tools & Technologies Used**

Category Tools/Technologies
Source Code Management Git, GitHub (with Webhook Integration)
CI/CD Orchestration Jenkins (Multibranch Pipeline + Shared Libraries)
Infrastructure as Code Terraform (with Remote Backend ‚Äì S3 + DynamoDB)
Configuration Management Ansible + Ansible Vault
Containerization Docker, DockerHub / AWS ECR
Container Orchestration Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
Secrets Management Ansible Vault or HashiCorp Vault
Monitoring & Logging Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana)
Notification/Alerting Slack, Email, or MS Teams via Jenkins plugins
Deployment Strategy Rolling Updates


üîß **Detailed Project Workflow (Point-Wise)**

1. ‚úÖ **GitHub Repository & Branching Strategy**
 ‚Ä¢ Set up a GitHub repository with branches: main, dev, and feature/*.
 ‚Ä¢ Created separate directories for frontend, backend, and other microservices.
 ‚Ä¢ Enabled GitHub Webhooks to notify Jenkins on each push or PR.
 ‚Ä¢ Configured Multibranch Pipeline in Jenkins to auto-discover and build each branch.

2. üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**
 ‚Ä¢ Defined reusable Terraform modules for:
     ‚Ä¢ VPC (with public/private subnets)
     ‚Ä¢ Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway
     ‚Ä¢ EC2 (for Jenkins and Ansible control node)
     ‚Ä¢ RDS (PostgreSQL or MySQL DB)
     ‚Ä¢ S3 Bucket (for Terraform backend)
     ‚Ä¢ DynamoDB (for state locking)
     ‚Ä¢ EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
     ‚Ä¢ Used terraform plan and terraform apply to deploy infrastructure in AWS.
     ‚Ä¢ Managed remote state using S3 and DynamoDB for collaboration and locking.

3. üîê **Configuration Management with Ansible**
 ‚Ä¢ Wrote Ansible playbooks to:
     ‚Ä¢ Install Docker, Kubernetes tools (kubectl, kubeadm, etc.)
     ‚Ä¢ Install Jenkins on EC2 (with plugins and initial setup)
     ‚Ä¢ Configure Jenkins security, global tools, and credentials
     ‚Ä¢ Set up monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
     ‚Ä¢ Used Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data like DB credentials, AWS keys.

4. üê≥ **Dockerization of Microservices**
 ‚Ä¢ Created separate Dockerfiles for:
     ‚Ä¢ Frontend ( Angular )
     ‚Ä¢ Backend APIs ( Spring Boot )
     ‚Ä¢ Auth & Payment microservices
     ‚Ä¢ Used docker-compose for local testing.
     ‚Ä¢ Built and pushed images to DockerHub or AWS ECR using CI pipeline.

5. ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes Deployment ( EKS )**
 ‚Ä¢ Wrote YAML manifests for:
     ‚Ä¢ Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
     ‚Ä¢ Configured Ingress Controller and external load balancer.
     ‚Ä¢ Used kubectl and Helm charts for deploying microservices.
     ‚Ä¢ Enabled horizontal pod autoscaling and rolling updates.

6. üõ†Ô∏è **CI/CD with Jenkins (Pipeline-as-Code)**
 ‚Ä¢ Wrote a Jenkinsfile with the following stages:
     1. Checkout code from GitHub
     2. Build Docker image
     3. Run unit tests
     4. Push image to DockerHub/ECR
     5. Deploy to Kubernetes using kubectl
     6. Post-build actions (notifications, cleanup)
     ‚Ä¢ Enabled:
     ‚Ä¢ Multibranch Pipeline for feature/PR builds
     ‚Ä¢ Shared libraries for DRY code (e.g., pipeline-library@dev)
     ‚Ä¢ Parameterized jobs (e.g., select environment: dev, stage, prod)

7. üìà **Monitoring & Logging Setup**
 ‚Ä¢ Installed and configured:
 ‚Ä¢ Prometheus for real-time metrics
 ‚Ä¢ Grafana for dashboards (e.g., CPU, memory, HTTP errors)
 ‚Ä¢ ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for application logs
 ‚Ä¢ Configured alert rules and notifications to Slack or Email.

8. üîê **Security Best Practices**
 ‚Ä¢ Managed secrets using Ansible Vault and environment variables.
 ‚Ä¢ Configured IAM roles and policies for least privilege on AWS.
 ‚Ä¢ Enabled audit logging and role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
 ‚Ä¢ Enforced access restrictions via NACLs and Security Groups in AWS.
